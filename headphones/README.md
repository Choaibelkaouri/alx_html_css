# 🎧 Headphones Landing Page — HTML & CSS Project

This project consists of building a fully functional **Headphones Landing Page** from scratch, using only **HTML** and **CSS**, based on the provided **Figma design**.  
No JavaScript and no CSS frameworks are allowed.

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End** curriculum.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal is to **reproduce the Figma design as accurately as possible** while applying best practices in:

- Semantic HTML  
- Clean, maintainable CSS  
- Accessibility (A11y)  
- Responsive Web Design  
- Pixel-perfect UI implementation

---

## 🖼️ Figma Design

Before starting the implementation, you must:

1. Create a Figma account  
2. Open the project file  
3. Click **“Duplicate to your Drafts”** to access all spacing, color, and typography details.

If the main link does not work, an alternative Figma file is provided.

### 🔤 Required fonts  
If your computer does not have the design fonts installed, download and install:

- **Source Sans Pro**
- **Spin Cycle OT**

These fonts ensure visual accuracy with the original design.

## 📐 Important Design Notes

- Some values in the Figma design are floating numbers — rounding is acceptable (e.g., 23.4 → 23px).
- Maximum width of the page content must be **1000px**, centered horizontally.
- The webpage must switch to the **mobile version at 480px screen width**.
- Interaction requirements:
  - Link hover/active color: `#FF6565`
  - Button hover/active behavior: `opacity: 0.9`

---

## 🚫 Restrictions (VERY IMPORTANT)

You **may NOT** use:

- JavaScript  
- Any CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)  
- Any external UI toolkit  
- Preprocessors (Sass, Less) unless clearly allowed

Use only:

✔ HTML  
✔ CSS  
✔ Flexbox / Grid  
✔ Media Queries
